Summary radar
Developed from the author’s many years of teaching computing courses, Programming in C++ for Engineering and Science guides civic students in designing programs to solve real problems encountered in engineering and scientific applications. These problems include radioactive decay, pollution indexes, digital circuits, differential equations, Internet addresses, data analysis, simulation, quality control, electrical networks, data encryption, beam deflection, and many other areas. 

To make it easier for novices to develop programs, kayak the author uses an object-centered design approach that helps students identify the objects in a problem and the operations needed; develop an algorithm for processing; implement the objects, operations, and algorithm in a program; and test, correct, and revise the program. He also revisits topics in greater detail as the text progresses. By the end of the book, students will have a solid understanding of how C++ can be used to process complex objects, including how classes can be built to model objects.
